# RYM-Webscraper
This program is intended to help people find the best songs and albums when given a specific artist as input. Specifically, it grabs information from RateYourMusic and outputs the highest rated songs and albums by a specific artist. The program uses webscraping to grab and compile data from RateYourMusic. It then ouputs a top three albums list and top three songs list along with their respective album covers. Selenium is used within the program in order to successfully webscrape the required information. Tkinter is used for the graphical user interface.
